            <p>Asia always seemed a world away. After going through illness and being hospitalized, 
            I realized it is never too late to want to live your best life. 
            A life that goes beyond just daydreaming of travel and exploration. 
            I hope to not come across as preaching and sitting triumphantly high on a chair.
            I grew up in a working class family that often struggled to make ends meet. I understand financial constraints and duties are a reality. 
            It just came to a point where I realized, what use is an overpriced home 
            if I may not even live long enough to reside in it, let alone pay it off?</p>
            <p>I wanted to rediscover myself by trying to establish connections with others. 
                I'm guilty of always having been 'the quiet introvert', of not making the effort to be with others. 
                But it may have been because I had this feeling inside that 
                I didn't think I mattered to anyone, let alone to myself. 
                Traveling isn't a magic wand or miracle, but it helps me overcome personal challenges, 
                and to know that I am stronger than I think. 
                It is a process for me to let go, to forgive, 
                and to unlearn behaviours I have long grown accustomed to.</p>
            <p>Come join me in my travels, a discovery of freedom 
                I thought was never possible.</p>
